# Emblems
The emblems we currently venerate demean all lives especially, lives of non-christian, black, indigenous and coloured peoples!

## All lives matter and especially, black lives matter

The depiction of Queen Elisabeth II in Victoria Park, Kitchener, ON, CA is a mere instance of how deeply racism is baked into our society. The statue emblematically represents the dominance of a well-fed, white, anglosaxon, aristrocat over the fallen flag of the peoples whose emblem used to be the African Lion. The position of the statue's arm with its Christianized sceptor dominating a "wild lion" (the African diaspora) shows how the lion has been tamed into submission throughout the world by the prowess of the mighty queen of England and the ingenuity of "the civilized English diaspora".

The cannon placed in front of the lion is reminiscent of a merchentile slave ship's cannons! This cannon is pointed at the face of drivers coming upto the bend to "warn" them of their inferior position and to submit to their master - the crown of England. 

Prior to the British Empire's emblems the city of Kitchener was called Berlin and hosted the erstwhile German Empire's emblems. If the rascist German Empire's emblems were removed and the city was renamed Kitchener in honour of [the genocidal Kitchener of Khartoum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Kitchener,_1st_Earl_Kitchener) then it is certainly high time that the flatulent British Empire's racist and degrading embelems be removed from public view.

The values we enshrine in our public spaces represent the truth we hold in our individual as well as our collective conscience! The inglorious truth about Canada is that we are racist to the core against peoples who are not-christian and not-white and this form of racism is deeply embedded into our day-to-day use of emblems on our fiat currencies and public installations that venerate genocide.
