# Emblems

The emblems we currently venerate demean all lives especially, the lives of non-christian, black, indigenous and peoples of colour!

## Especially Black Lives Matter

The depiction of Queen Victoria in Victoria Park, Kitchener, ON, Canada, is a mere instance of how deeply racism is baked into our society. The statue emblematically represents the dominance of a well-fed, white, Anglo-Saxon, *aristocat* over the fallen flag of the peoples whose emblem used to be the African Lion. The position of the statue's arm with its Christianized scepter dominating a "wild lion" (the African diaspora) shows how the lion has been tamed into submission throughout the world by the prowess of the mighty, aristocratic Queen of England using the ingenuity of "the civilized English diaspora."

The cannon placed in front of the lion is reminiscent of a mercantile slave ship's cannons! This cannon is pointed at the face of drivers coming up to the bend, to "warn" them of their inferior position, and for them to submit to their master — the crown of England. 

Prior to the British Empire's conquest of Canada, the city of Kitchener was called Berlin. It hosted the erstwhile German Empire's emblems with the bust of Kaiser Wilhelm the First, displayed in what is now called [Victoria Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park,_Kitchener#Statue_of_Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor), as shown in the picture below.

If the racist German Empire's emblems were removed and the city was renamed Kitchener, then it is certainly high time that the decaying British Empire's racist and degrading emblems, also be removed from public view. 

Sadly Berlin, Ontario Canada was renamed Kitchener, Ontario, Canada in recognition of **[the genocidal Kitchener of Khartoum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Kitchener,_1st_Earl_Kitchener)** . Our city venerates his murderous conquests in North and East Africa that promoted concentration camps and slavery.  


Where is the racism you ask? It is embedded all around us, in each and every system, from the urban design and naming of cities, to the money we are beholden to. The values we enshrine in our public spaces and currencies represent the truth we hold in our individual as well as our collective conscience! The inglorious truth about Canada is that we are racist to the core against peoples who are not-christian and not-white. 

Do you now understand the form of racism that is systematically embedded into our day-to-day use of emblems, on our fiat currencies, and in our public installations that venerate genocide?

**Note:** This article was the first one I had printed and posted on public message boards in Kitchener, in February-2020. In May-2020 I was arrested by Waterloo Regional Police (WRPS) who detained me illegally in a substitute jail for weeks. But, WRPS records indicate that I was never arrested by them! While I was being tormented and tortured in a jail-like environment by Canadian agents, on the fifth day, I was asked about this article and my social media comments by the interrogator who used to visit me each day. I told them that it was an opinion piece and that I was free to express my views in print and in other media. They then continued to hold me captive. A week after that, I asked for my legal representative, which prompted them to increase their torture tactics through which they caused me reproductive and sexual harms. Then a week after that, I was simply tossed out onto the streets, and told to go home. In June-2020, I published this article online.
