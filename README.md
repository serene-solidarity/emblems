# Emblems
The emblems we currently venerate demean all lives especially, lives of non-christian, black, indigenous and peoples of colour!

## Especially Black Lives Matter

The depiction of Queen Victoria in Victoria Park, Kitchener, ON, CA is a mere instance of how deeply racism is baked into our society. The statue emblematically represents the dominance of a well-fed, white, anglosaxon, *aristocat* over the fallen flag of the peoples whose emblem used to be the African Lion. The position of the statue's arm with its Christianized scepter dominating a "wild lion" (the African diaspora) shows how the lion has been tamed into submission throughout the world by the prowess of the mighty, aristocratic Queen of England using the ingenuity of "the civilized English diaspora."

The cannon placed in front of the lion is reminiscent of a mercantile slave ship's cannons! This cannon is pointed at the face of drivers coming upto the bend to "warn" them of their inferior position and to submit to their master - the crown of England. 

Prior to the British Empire's conquest of Canada the city of Kitchener was called Berlin. It hosted the erstwhile German Empire's emblems with the bust of Kaiser Wilhelm the First, displayed in what is now called Victoria Park as shown in the picture below.

If the racist German Empire's emblems were removed and the city was renamed Kitchener then it is certainly high time that the decaying British Empire's racist and degrading emblems be removed from public view. 

Sadly Berlin, Ontario Canada was renamed Kitchener, Ontario, Canada in recognition of **[the genocidal Kitchener of Khartoum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Kitchener,_1st_Earl_Kitchener)** . Our city venerates his murderous conquests in North and East Africa that promoted concertration camps and slavery.  


Where is the racism you ask? It is embedded all around us in each and every system from the urban design and naming of cities to the money we are beholden to. The values we enshrine in our public spaces and currencies represent the truth we hold in our individual as well as our collective conscience! The inglorious truth about Canada is that we are racist to the core against peoples who are not-christian and not-white. 

Do you now understand the form of racism that is systematically embedded into our day-to-day use of emblems on our fiat currencies and public installations that venerate genocide?
